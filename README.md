# Image to PDF using Python
A very short Python project to convert multiple image files to a single PDF file.

## üìö Used library

- [img2pdf](https://pypi.org/project/img2pdf/): A Python library that converts image files to PDF format.

## üíª Run the project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tranquil-ou/image-to-pdf.git`
2. Go to the project directory: `cd image-to-pdf`
3. Install `img2pdf` library: `pip install img2pdf`
4. Change the file directory in the `Script.py` file to point to the directory containing your image files.
5. Run the project: `python Script.py`
6. The script will convert the specified image files into a single PDF file named `ImageContainingBook.pdf` in the project directory.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `Script.py`: The Python script responsible for converting the image files to a PDF.
- Sample image files: Example image files that you can use for testing.
- `ImageContainingBook.pdf`: The output PDF file that will be generated after running the script.

## üöÄ Additional Notes

- You can customize the script to adjust the layout, quality, and other parameters of the generated PDF.
- Make sure your image files are in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF) for successful conversion.
- Feel free to explore and modify the project according to your needs.

Happy coding!
